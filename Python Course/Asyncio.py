#Async IO is a powerful programming pattern that allows for high-performance and concurrent I/O operations in Python. With the asyncio module and asynchronous functions, you can write efficient and scalable code that can handle large amounts of data and I/O operations without blocking the main thread. Whether you're working on web applications, network services, or data processing pipelines, async IO is an essential tool for any Python developer.

  print("func 1")
